### About Eng:

        Eng is abbreviated from "Engine".By using this shortened sign,we mean it can
        actually act as an engine to drive the Data-structure & the Dom-structure 
        organically and coherently.If we prefer to adopt "inertial thinking" policy 
        in analyzing the challenging problem that confronts us,the interaction 
        between data  processing and the Dom-structure can be simplified on 
        most ocassions.

        Eng is componentized solution, Currently only 11 KB ,Only five basic 
        instruction and five (option/methods),You can achieve angular , vue 
        and react tool commonly used functions(by 2017-8)
        
        Eng has an exceptional performance in all similar software, as well as minimal 
        learning difficulty.
